                <p> <b>Hello!</b> This website is the final piece that I need to complete my four years of undergrad as a Computer and Information Science major! I've put a lot of time and work into it so I genuinely hope you enjoy it!
                    What you will find on this website is really interesting data found by scraping data from the well known dating website, OkCupid. This dating site is not as popular as the notorious Tinder or
                    Bumble, but it allows the user to add so much information that is really easy to access. 
                        </br>
                    Originally I planned to scrape from multiple websites, but that idea quickly failed once I realized how much time I needed to spend just scraping from this single site. Perhaps if I had previous 
                    knowledge on the subject and much more time then I could have scraped from a variety of dating websites, but for this project we're keeping it clean and simple.

                        <p>This is the lovely profile that I created on </br>
                            <a href="https://www.okcupid.com">OkCupid.com</a>, I stupidly used my real name and </br>
                            age, but that's the only information that's really</br>
                            my own. I kept everything very vague, since the</br>
                            goal here was not to actually get people to like</br>
                            me. As you can see there are many sections to</br>
                            add personal likes and dislikes about general or </br>
                            specific topics. It is also very simple to edit </br>
                            the information on your page including your </br>
                            gender, sexual orientation, and status. </br></br>
                            Creating this profile was the first step </br>
                            in making this project. Keep scrolling for</br>

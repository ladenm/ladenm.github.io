I thought that this type of visualization did a better job at representing the different types of ethnicities that each man claimed to be. It's interesting because they can place these identifiers in any order and out of the nearly 400 men most of them wanted it to be knonw that they were a "straight man" before anything else. Some wanted it to be known that they are white and speak english. THere is a very small percentage of African American, Asian, and multi-ethnic. Which is not that surprising for upstate NY.</span>

                    <p>I had a lot of fun making this website and doing the project for the last few months. From collecting the data of nearly 400 men, using tableau to easily create data visualizations, and then spending hours on end making this website, I have spent a little over 90 hours working on this. It might not seem like much, but I learn a lot and I can confidently say that I'm happy with the final product. It's far from perfect, but the one thing that I would definitely add is making the website responsive. It's not responsive at all and display larger or smaller than my laptop will look pretty terrible. But it looks good from where I'm sitting!</br> </br>We use data analysis to answer the questions we have and we use visualizations to help us better understand the data and comprehend it more quickly and efficiently. I think I achieved that with the visualizations I created, and I answered the questions that I had regarding dating website. And even though my profile was as vague as possible, and my photo was a flower, I still received messages everyday about another person liking my profile. In total I got approximately 250 likes...I'm not really sure what that says about the people in Upstate NY using OkCupid, but I'm still flattered either way. I hope this was somewhat fun to look at and see a little farther into the strange world of online dating. </br></br></br></p>
